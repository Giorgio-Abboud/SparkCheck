# SparkCheck

**SparkCheck** is a real-time data engineering project designed to detect and flag deceitful misinformation using a data pipeline powered by Apache Kafka, Spark, Airflow, and NLP.

## Project Goal

To fight the rampant spread of false or misleading information online. With misinformation becoming increasingly abundant and potentially harmful, it's critical to identify and verify claims in real time.

## Tech Stack

- **Apache Kafka** – Real-time data ingestion  
- **Apache Spark** – Scalable data processing  
- **Apache Airflow** – Pipeline orchestration and monitoring  
- **PostgreSQL** – Structured data storage  
- **Streamlit** – Interactive frontend application  
- **Python** – Core logic and NLP (Natural Language Processing)

## Project Plan (Phase 1 – MVP)

1. Set up a Kafka producer to read claims from a JSON file  
2. Configure a Kafka consumer to store the data in a PostgreSQL database  
3. Setting up for NLP-based fact-check matching (planned in later phases)

## Future Works In Progress ⚙️🚧
