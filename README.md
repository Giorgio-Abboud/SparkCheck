## Project Phases

### ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Infrastructure (In Progress)**
- `init_project.py` to auto-generate `.env`, `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `requirements.txt`
- PostgreSQL container using **Chainguard secure image**
- Environment-aware Docker configurations (dev vs prod)
- Persistent volume setup for database
- Kafka producer to ingest claims from JSON [Coming Soon]
- Kafka consumer to store in PostgreSQL [Coming Soon]
